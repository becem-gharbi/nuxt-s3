# Introduction

Nuxt S3 is an unofficial module for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) that provides a lightweight object storage layer. It's based on [Unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/).

Two drivers are supported:

- NodeJS Filesystem to store objects locally. This can be useful in the development and deployment of stateful environments. This driver is provided by [unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/fs).

- S3 client to store objects remotely. This can be useful in deployment to serverless and edge environments. This driver is an HTTP client that uses [aws4fetch](https://github.com/mhart/aws4fetch) to sign requests for backend authorization.
