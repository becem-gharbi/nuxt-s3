# Caching

For private buckets, it's recommended to cache the query endpoint via `/api/s3/query/**` route rules.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
  routeRules: {
    "/api/s3/query/**": { isr: true },
  },
```

For public buckets, it's recommended to directly serve objects from the service provider.

Given the bucket's `public_bucket_url`, the key can be extracted from the object's `url` via `getKey` function of `useS3Object`. Then the publicURL would be `{public_bucket_url}/{key}`
