# Authorization

By default the server endpoints are publicly accessible, thus it's mandatory to implement authorization.

To do so `s3:auth` hook is provided to pass the authorization header on `upload` and `remove`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtPlugin({
  hooks: {
    "s3:auth": (headers) => {
      headers.authorization = "bearer ";
    },
  },
});
```

Then on the server side, a middleware should be created to intercept mutation endpoints. The object's metadata set on `upload` is accessible on the server side via `getMeta` utility. The metadata is intended to contain user info, e.g. `id`, and thus can be used for authorization.

```ts
import { getMeta } from "#s3";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { pathname } = getRequestURL(event);
  const isS3Mutation = pathname.startsWith("/api/s3/mutation");

  if (isS3Mutation) {
    const meta = await getMeta(event);
  }
});
```
