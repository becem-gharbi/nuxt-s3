# Authorization

By default the server endpoints are publicly accessible, thus it's mandatory to implement authorization.

To do so `s3:auth` hook is provided to pass authorization header on `upload` and `remove`.

```js
export default defineNuxtPlugin({
  hooks: {
    "s3:auth": (headers) => {
      headers.authorization = "bearer ";
    },
  },
});
```

Then on server-side, a middleware should be created to validate the authorization header.

```js
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const { pathname } = getRequestURL(event);
  const isS3Mutation = pathname.startsWith("/api/s3/mutation");

  if (isS3Mutation) {
    // check authorization
  }
});
```

At this point an authorized user can perform the remove of any object. However a user should be allowed to remove only objects that he have uploaded. To restrict this behaviour, there is multiple solutions. For example, on upload prefix the key with the userId. And on mutation middleware verify it.
