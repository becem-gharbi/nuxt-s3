# Validation

On `upload` the input file is validated both client-side and server-side.

The constaints are defined on module config. `accept` is a regex to validate the mime type for example `^image/(png|jpeg|png|gif)` to allow only image upload. `maxSizeMb` is the maximum size for upload.

```js
s3: {
    accept: '',
    maxSizeMb: 10
}
```
