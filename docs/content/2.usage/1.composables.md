## Composables

The module is intended to be used on client-side via `useS3Object` composable.

#### Remove

The `remove` function can be used to delete a single object.

```js
function remove(url: string): Promise<void> {}
```

The `url` refers to the object's download path which is `/api/s3/query/{key}`. The `key` uniquely identifies the object in the bucket.

#### Upload

The `upload` function can be used to upload a single object.

```js
function upload(
  file: File,
  opts?: { url?: string, key?: string, prefix?: string }
) {}
```

Two logics are performed

- Key naming: the object's key is by default a UUID. In order to organize objects in the bucket, you can assign to it a custom key `opts.key` or prefix the default via `opts.prefix`. Please refer to AWS docs for [guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html).

- Create or update: A new object is created and if `opts.url` is provided then the related object is deleted from the bucket.
